Storage
=======

Some kind of storage is needed to persist the annotations that you create while
on a web page.

To do this you can use the :doc:`http` and a remote JSON API. :doc:`http-api`
describes the API implemented by the `reference backend
<https://github.com/openannotation/annotator-store>`__. It is this backend that
runs the `AnnotateIt <http://annotateit.org>`__ web service.
